# PigGame
Small HTML/CSS/JS Project demonstrating Frontend Programming Concepts

# Objective:
Be the first player to reach a target score (commonly 100).

# Players:
2 or more players take turns rolling a die (or dice).

# Rules:
## Starting the Game:
Each player starts with a score of 0.
Players take turns rolling a die.
## During a Turn:
The player rolls a die and adds the result to their current score for that turn.
The player can choose to: (1) Roll again to try to accumulate more points in the current turn or (2) Hold to save their current score and add it to their total score.
## Rolling a 1:
If the player rolls a 1, their current score for the turn is reset to 0, and their turn ends.
They lose any points they accumulated during that turn.
## Holding:
A player can "hold" at any time during their turn, adding their current score to their total score and ending their turn.
This strategy is used to avoid rolling a 1 and losing points.
## Winning the Game:
The first player to reach the target score (e.g., 100 points) wins.
If multiple players reach the target score in the same round, the one with the higher score wins.
